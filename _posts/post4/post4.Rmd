# Introduction 

In this blog post I will be reviewing Soban's R package "covidham" cmade for Assignment 2 of ETC5523 contain coronavirus data, functions and shiny application. This package can be found via Github here. Further, the pkgdown site can be found here. The shiny application contained in the package analysis the state of coronavirus in most Aisan countries being "the most densely populated continent and the origin of the pandemic." 

The application contains a plot of Stringency Index (the level of emergency declared and the level of precautions taken by government.) This variable is scaled from 0-100 (1oo = strictest.) Further, a scatter plot has been included comparing 3 coronavirus related variables at once across Asian countries (1 variable on the x-axis, 1 on the y-axis and the last variable being the size and colour of the point.) Some variables that can be plotted include, total cases, total deaths, population and more. All variables included can be viewed through the `covid_data` used to create the package. data tables have been included also showing the total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths of specific Asian countries at a particular date.

# What did I think this package would do? Did it do it?

At the onset of viewing the github page the readme file provides a clear picture of what the shiny application includes having the introduction slide of the package explaining what is included in the applicaiton.
